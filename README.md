===============================

Adds a species feature ``survives_space``, which defines if a pokemon can survive in space.
Doesn't add any spawns yet, though I may do this in future. Its also neoforge because thats what my friends server
was but like the code is probably identical for a fabric version icba for multiloader cus I've not done that before 
anyway yeah feel free to fork and make better or add to the default list
